#The function I choose to make is a plot which I used a lot in the Stat545 mda. This function creates a standard scatterplot.

#' @param x A numerical variable in a dataset.
#I named this variable x to describe the independent variable being investigated
#' @param y A numerical variable in a dataset.
#I named this variable y to describe the dependent variable being investigated
